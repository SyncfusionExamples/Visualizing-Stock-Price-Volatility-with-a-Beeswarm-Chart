# Visualizing Stock Data Distribution Using Syncfusion .NET MAUI Beeswarm Chart

## Overview
This .NET MAUI application demonstrates advanced data visualization techniques by creating a Beeswarm Chart using Syncfusion's powerful charting controls. It showcases stock price distributions across multiple companies (Amazon, Google, Netflix, Facebook) over time, providing an intuitive way to analyze price clustering, volatility patterns, and market trends.

## Beeswarm Chart?
A beeswarm chart is a specialized data visualization technique that displays individual data points along a single axis while preventing overlap through intelligent positioning. Unlike traditional scatter plots, beeswarm charts "push" overlapping points away from each other perpendicular to the main axis, creating a swarm-like appearance that reveals data distribution patterns while preserving exact values.

**Purpose**:

**Stock Analysis**: Perfect for visualizing stock price distributions over time periods.    
**Market Comparison**: Compare multiple companies' trading ranges simultaneously.   
**Volatility Patterns**: Identify periods of high/low price volatility through point density.   
**Outlier Detection**: Easily spot unusual trading prices that deviate from normal ranges.
